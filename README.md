# ToDoList Back-End Project

Site can be found at http://www.hectorramosjr.com/todo/ . 
The language used for the backend was Python, and the framework used was Django. 
The latest version of this app can be found at this repo! https://github.com/HectorRamosJunior/PersonalWebsite/tree/master/todo

The front-end needs work visually, but the site features user authentication and provides each user their own unique to-do list.
The site uses AJAX to interact with the database on the backend without constantly having to reload the page.
